# Geophysical Data Clustering in the Gawler Craton

This repository contains the notebooks and scripts necessary to reproduce the results presented in a paper currently under review by Shirmard et al. These tools allow users to generate clustered maps using magnetic and gravity data from the Gawler Craton.

## Input Files

The input files consist of preprocessed magnetic and gravity grids. The project also explores the relationship between the mapped clusters and different types of mineralization. These include mafic-ultramafic intrusion-hosted mineralization of cobalt, chromium, and nickel, as well as intrusion-related and sediment-hosted mineralization of gold, copper, iron, and manganese.

## Output Files

The final output is a GeoTIFF file that displays the mapped clusters for the Gawler Craton.
